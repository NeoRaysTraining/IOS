//Procedure to take path of file


Navigate to the file or folder you wish to copy the path for.
Right-click (or Control+Click, or a Two-Finger click on trackpads) on the file or folder in the Mac Finder.
While in the right-click menu, hold down the OPTION key to reveal the “Copy (item name) as Pathname” option, it replaces the standard Copy option.
